# ogama - open gaze and mouse analyzer
Ogama allows recording and analyzing eye- and mouse-tracking data from slideshow eyetracking experiments in parallel. 
It´s developed in C#.NET and provides attention maps, AOIS, saliency, replay, levensthein distances and many more visualization tools.

Have a look at the feature video at OGAMAs homepage at http://www.ogama.net/node/34.

This software allows recording and analyzing eye- and mouse-tracking data from slideshow eyetracking experiments in parallel. OGAMA is freeware, written in C#.NET and released as an open source project. Its main features include database-driven pre-processing and filtering of gaze and mouse data, the creation of attention maps, areas of interest definition, saliency calculation (Itti&Koch 2001), levenshtein distance calculation and replay (with .avi recording). Nearly any eyetracking and/or presentation soft- and hardware recordings in ASCII format can be imported. Direct recording is possible with commercial tracking systems from Tobii, alea or SMI and with the ITU Gazetracker open source solution which uses infrared ready webcams or a modified PlayStationEye camera.
Data output is provided that can directly be used with different statistical software packages. Because it is open source you can adapt it to suit your needs. Just contact us!

Please note: from Mai 2016 on I have no more time to support this project anymore. It´s more than five years since I left university and coded and supported this project just for fun. But as you might know, this is a huge code basis and there are too much support and feature requests for my limited time. But at least it is open source. so get your hands on it, if you like it. Until someone takes over the administraton I may add you to the developers list on codeplex. Thanks for the good time!
